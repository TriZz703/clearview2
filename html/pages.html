<div id="testimonials">
	<p>"In the fall of 2005, the opportunity to purchase a piece of property that met all of our geographic requirements (proximity to the town of Vienna, within the boundaries of the same schools) serendipitously occurred after years of investigating leads on properties. The first step after purchasing the property was finding a builder for our dream house. After many interviews with builders, we selected JP Sorrell to build our house. Why? He had a wealth of experience building houses. He had recently built custom homes that reflected some of our design choices. He had a strong relationship with an architect whose work we admired from our first review of his work. He was a local Vienna builder, resident and neighbor. But most compelling of all was JP's enthusiasm for wanting to build our house. That landed him the job.</p>
	
	<p>Following that, the design process proceeded and construction began the summer of 2006. This was a custom home, and we were aware up front that construction would require time. Even so, the smooth nature of decision making and modification surprised us. JP kept the process moving forward at all times. There were very few days in the one year it took from groundbreaking to move-in that construction sat idle. JP's attention to detail and his ability to find, motivate, and supervise quality subcontractors is one of JP's strongest qualities. No key feature that we required in our house was left off the plan. It was (and is) our dream house.</p> 
	
	<p>Labor Day 2007, we moved into our house. Several friends who had custom built houses had warned us about the punch lists that go forgotten and to expect first year problems. JP continued to work with us on the punch list items, none of which were unexpected or critical for comfortable living. Never did first year (or second year) problems with any of the house systems that our friends warned us of materialize. From a maintenance perspective, we were looking at the replacement of light bulbs as being our number one item. All of the few items that could be called first-year warranty issues took a simple call to JP who had the sub on site and shortly thereafter had the problem solved.</p>
	
	<p>Our family has enjoyed the house we are calling "the last house we will live in" for two years now. We would change nothing. Any improvements are all considered cosmetic, such as adding built-ins and starting that basement wet bar, but those are secondary items in our plans.</p> 
	
	<p>The strongest testimonial we can give is the answer to the question that friends ask us all the time, "Would you do this again, because we know so many people who say it was a nightmare and they would never do it again." Our response is, "In a heartbeat." Though in truth we will not need to because we built this house anticipating the various stages of our lives (including changing needs as we grow older), so this is the last house we will need to live in."</p>
	
	<p>~ Walt Brady and Carol Ward</p>
	
	
	<p>"We are more than happy to recommend JP and Clearview Homes. We love our house! We had great and likely unique experience with JP. We were living overseas and did all the design, selections and construction monitoring over the Internet.</p> 
	
	<p>JP was recommend by friends who have known him for years. JP impressed me immediately. When I called, he invited me to join him at a construction site. He's a builder who wants to show you his work. He's not a salesman with a fancy brochure and "model" home. I'm an engineer by training and walking through the home under construction showed me that he builds great solid houses.</p> 
	
	<p>JP introduced us to an architect who is used to working over the Internet and we completed the entire process via email and a just a few personal meetings. JP was great about making recommendations on color and design selections and directing us to websites to help us do our research. During construction I had friends and family walk-thru and send us photos. One friend, who has masters in Civil Engineering, was also very impressed with JP and Clearview's construction techniques. Many people told us we were crazy to trust a contractor, but we could not be happier with our house.</p> 
	
	<p>We had a very ambitious construction schedule as we were moving back from overseas and JP finished in just under 11 months. Our friends who have done similar construction jobs were shocked. And we came in at budget, again a shock.</p> 
	
	<p>So the engineer in the family loves the house, but how does it look? At least once or twice a month we see strangers parked in front of the house to take pictures. A few have even knocked on our door to ask who built it."</p>
