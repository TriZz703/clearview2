<h1>Investing in the Future</h1>

<p>
With many roots in the Vienna area, John "JP" Sorrell was committed to bringing excellence into the diverse pool of local builders, when he opened the doors of <strong>Clear View Homes, LLC.</strong> in 2005. He believes that quality workmanship should be the high standard homes are built to, not just putting one after another "Cookie Cutter" home up.  To gain the knowledge and skill required of every level of construction JP apprenticed under other master craftsmen for many years, going from a Laborer to Carpenter to Forman to Superintendent. With all of that experience JP managed the construction of over 120 homes while with Michael Harris Homes, from breaking ground to handing over the key. Having worked in every facet of the business, JP felt it was time to part ways and bring his own keen vision, to the world of custom home building.
</p>
<p>
Since 1986 JP has expanded his familiarity and expertise with all aspects of home building to cultivate the brilliance in construction you deserve. It is his goal to provide steadfast, trustworthy & honest workmanship in every home he turns out. From hand carved millwork to artisan painting to landscaping, the dynamic team of craftsmen JP works with consistently meets and often exceeds the expectations of the client, with the superiority of their work.
